How the program works:
The program takes the user input and makes it all lowercase so it can compare with the predefined words. 
It uses indexOf to check if a predefined word is in the user input. If indexOf is not equal to
-1 that means the word is in the user input. Then it uses an if statement and Math.random() to choose
a random response to print out. The response will answer the question keyword. If the user input has nice keywords
it will thank the user in a random way and compliment them. However, if the sentence also contains "not"
then it will respond in a mean way because the the word "not" changes the nice word into a mean phrase.
If the user input has mean keywords it will respond in a random mean way. However, if the sentence also contains
"not" then it will respond in a nice way because the word "not" changes the mean word into a nice phrase.
If the user's input does not contain any predefined keywords it prints out a list of keywords for the user to choose
from when writing their messages.
