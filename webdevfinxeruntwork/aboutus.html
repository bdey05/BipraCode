        <p class = "ptag">What is the International Socioeconomics Laboratory? How did it come into existence?</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "bottom">
        <p class = "paragraph"> 
          The ISL is an international research network for finding the best solutions to current socio economic problems. We use already existing information and create our own through comprehensive models and studies to find out which policies are the best or why something in society works the way it does. The International Socioeconomics Laboratory started as just an idea. At first, it was just a goal for the Finxerunt research committees to accomplish sometime in the future, however, with all the resources for it already laid down and with a lot of willpower, it became a real sister organization to Finxerunt.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraph">
          The International Socioeconomics Laboratory plans on having its research used by Finxspire to create real political policy and positive change in the world. Our research will also be the basis of many Finxerunt campaigns, podcasts, and films, especially for research directed more towards social change instead of political change.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraph">
          ISL is an international Socioeconomic Research Organization, one of the only, and largest, of its kind. The International Socioeconomics Laboratory will have over 120 members this spring, many multiples more than other socio economic research organizations. In addition to this, ISL is under the Finx umbrella, meaning that our research will go directly towards our own lobbying organization, called Finxspire. This will allow Finxspire to have its own in-house lab for research.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraph">
          The International Socioeconomics Laboratory will give its member plenty of benefits, such as a chance to gain over a hundred volunteer hours, earn a signed PVSA award from the POTUS, countless opportunities for leadership, a chance to compete for thousands of dollars worth of grants and scholarships, the ability to meet many prominent politicians, and of course, make new friends from all over the world.
